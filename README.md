# Life-Flip-Datapack
A challenge datapack for Minecraft 1.18+
Inspired/based by the character 'Tainted Lazarus' from Binding of Isaac

**This datapack is NOT multiplayer friendly!**

Use **/trigger flip.start** to start flipping
Use **/trigger flip.stop** to stop flipping

Remember to use **/reload** in case something isn't working


# **Ω Life Flip Ω**

Ω Every 30 seconds, you will flip between you and your alter ego.

Ω This means that you will be practically playing as two characters!

Ω But that doesn't end there...



# Inventory

Ω Both forms have their own inventory, meaning you have to share resources between them.

Ω That includes the hotbar, the whole inventory, and even the armor!



# Health

Ω Both forms have their own health, meaning that you have to heal them separately.

Ω They do share hunger, though... (cough cough, vanilla limitations...)



# Alter ego

Your other form has some differences from you...

Ω More strength (+3)
Ω Immune to poison
Ω A bit less movement speed (-0.15)
Ω A bit less attack speed (-0.1)
Ω 8 hearts of maximum health



# Color Meaning

Ω Red: Your regular form (normal)

Ω Blue: Your other form (alter ego)



# Have fun!

I really liked Tainted Lazarus gimmick (more than the gameplay though lol), so I wanted to see how it'd be like in Minecraft :)

Any feedback and ideas are welcome!
